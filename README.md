# 天使 Bot / Tenshi Bot

## This bot is created and is being maintained for the Discord Japanese Learning Server, [日本語勉強部](https://discord.gg/studyjapanese). 
I have no intention on making the Bot accessible to the public as this is a personal project for a personal server.

and will scan their results continously.

#### Notifies User that they passed the current Quiz they're taking.
Users are informed by the Bot through an embed that they have passed the current Quiz they are taking. <br/>
The Bot will then give the User their role afterwards.

#### Notifies User that someone else finished the Quiz that they started.
Users are informed by the Bot that the Quiz they have started are finished or passed by someone else. <br/>
This is a sign of cheating, and a clear interruption of the Quiz. No roles will be given to anyone <br/>
regardless if they are the one who passed the Quiz or not.
